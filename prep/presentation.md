# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* "So I suppose everybody knows who Bruce Lee is? Yes he's probably one of the most famous martial artists of all time. GIF of movie with nunchuks. Has anyone wondered how he's gotten to the mastery that he has? Well, let me show you today."

## Product
* Pictures of the product
* Pictures of the code
* Product designs

## Process
* I will talk about my process by talking about my biggest challenges, which was figuing out how to use the jQuery,
* Why I decided to pick my topic(I've done it for years and feel like it's a good skill for people to know in todays society)

## Conclusion
* Takeaways: Just because something isn't working doesn't mean you should just give up on it
ex. Before jQuery, there was supposed to be React, but after I couldn't figure it out in 20 minutes, I moved onto jQuery, and then realized it takes more than 20 minutes to get some basics.
* Expect the unexpected to happen
ex. While adding my tool into my code, I expected my navbar to open and close the way I wanted it to, but it didn't, and with trial and error, I got it to slightly work the way I wanted it to.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
