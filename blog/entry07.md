# Entry 7
##### 6/6/25

Since the making of the last blog entry, we have done our presentations to our class, as well as our elevator pitches in the lunchroom. I created and used [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C8YxAGayr4ChDg01Z6PB35lfITWGLnGYBPx1QFg-XvI/edit) to present to the class, and I created my own script for our elevator pitches.

### Takeaway(Presentation)
Based on the presentations that we did in class, and the feedback I recieved, one thing I could work on is raising my voice more so that it's easier for the everyone to hear the presentation. Not only was it good to speak louder, but it also would've helped to speak clearer, and to try and range your presentation to about 6 or 7 minutes. It can't be too short because then it would be an elevator pitch, but it can't be too long to the point people lose interest. It also helps to add a little bit of fluff to what you're talking about. You don't wanna stray too far from your point, but you should incorperate some stories about the challenges.

### Takeaway(Expo)
The Expo turned out a lot different compared to what I had originally experienced before. When creating the script, I had to take out all the fluff from the presentations since we weren't presenting anymore, we were more pitching our websites. We had 90 seconds to pitch our websites, so we had to talk about the website directly, and then hope that people wanted to check out the presentation later on and find out more about it. It was extremely important to not get distracted by friends or people who came in and made a ruse, because if you get distracted you could lose the interest of the people your pitching to, and that's important when you wanna try to pitch to many people.

### EDP
At this point in the freedom project, we have done everything and are at the very end of the engineer design process. The next steps for the EDP of this website is to go back to the code and fix things that you felt wanted to be changes. Go even further beyond a Minimum Viable Product, and to just keep improving it.

### Skills
#### Professionalism
Besides having to have some sort of professionalism while writing, there's also a level of professionalism that needs to be kept when doing things like presentations. When doing the elevator pitch, it was different since it was much more relaxed, but when doing official presentations in front of the class, you needed to do some basic things like posture up, speak clear and precise, and then not doing any funny buisness while up presenting was many of the key aspects to a great presentation.

#### Leadership
This skill is a very important skill to have no matter what you work in or what you're doing, leadership is important. Taking action and taking the initiative is a very important thing to have. While leadership couldn't be shown during in class presentations, leadership could be seen a lot during expos, when people would walk up to your presentation and ask to be presented to, but also going up to people and starting the pitch, that's one of the biggest ways leadership was shown since the last blog entry.
