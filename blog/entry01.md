# Entry 1: Deciding on our Topic

##### 10/7/24

The topic I decided to choose for my freedom project is martial arts because I've always liked training and learning martial arts. I had researched about Gambling and Cards, like trading cards, but they didn't really stand out to me the way martial arts has. When I first started researching for my Freedom Project, I was sure that I'd wanted to do Taekwondo, and so I had done lots of research to try and find more about Taekwondo. I used (https://www.kukkiwon.or.kr/base/main/view) so that I could try to find out about the differences between World Taekwondo, and International Taekwondo. However, when I actually thought about it deeply, even though I'm passionate about Taekwondo, I'm also passionate about other martial arts, like Boxing and Jiu-jitsu. That's when I realized that instead of trying to do something on just Taewondo, I'd instead do something about all nartial arts, or as many as I can research on. That's when I started using (https://www.sportsmed.org/membership/sports-medicine-update/summer-2024/mixed-martial-arts-injury-patterns-trends-and-misconceptions) to try and research some of the misconceptions behing Mixed Martial Arts. These helped me learn remember that there are many misconceptions in the world, and people always need to look out for them.

## Engineer Design Proccess
Currently, I am in the first steps of the Engineer Design Proccess, where you have to define the problem. The problem I am trying to solve with my project is teaching people how to be able to stand up for themselves if they ever get into a situation where they need to defend themselves, or protect people. The next steps in the Engineer Desing Proccess is to research my topic, and I plan on doing this research by using websites and articles, but also trying to go into different martial arts centers and trying to interview people on their view of their martial art, or martial arts in general.

## Skills
Some skills that I learned through this blog is how to research, patience, and I learned respect through the research I did.

##### How to Research
When I found the time to try and research, I kept searching things up and not getting the results I was looking for. To try and fix this, I had to start searching things much more specific to help me get to what I needed to get. FOr example, I was searching for the official website for MMA, and for Taekwondo, but when I searched it, I was shown Wikipedia.
