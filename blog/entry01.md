# Entry 1: Deciding on our Topic

##### 10/7/24

The topic I decided to choose for my freedom project is martial arts because I've always liked training and learning martial arts. I had researched about Gambling and Cards, like trading cards, but they didn't really stand out to me the way martial arts has. When I first started researching for my Freedom Project, I was sure that I'd wanted to do Taekwondo, and so I had done lots of research to try and find more about Taekwondo. I used (https://www.kukkiwon.or.kr/base/main/view) so that I could try to find out about the differences between World Taekwondo, and International Taekwondo. However, when I actually thought about it deeply, even though I'm passionate about Taekwondo, I'm also passionate about other martial arts, like Boxing and Jiu-jitsu. That's when I realized that instead of trying to do something on just Taewondo, I'd instead do something about all nartial arts, or as many as I can research on. That's when I started using (https://www.sportsmed.org/membership/sports-medicine-update/summer-2024/mixed-martial-arts-injury-patterns-trends-and-misconceptions) to try and research some of the misconceptions behing Mixed Martial Arts. These helped me learn remember that there are many misconceptions in the world, and people always need to look out for them.

## Engineer Design Process
Currently, I am in the first steps of the Engineer Design Process, where you have to define the problem. The problem I am trying to solve with my project is teaching people how to be able to stand up for themselves if they ever get into a situation where they need to defend themselves, or protect people. The next steps in the Engineer Design Process is to research my topic, and I plan on doing this research by using websites and articles, but also trying to go into different martial arts centers and trying to interview people on their view of their martial art, or martial arts in general.

## Skills
Some skills that I learned through this blog are how to research, patience, and I learned respect through the research I did.

##### How to Research
When I found the time to try and research, I kept searching things up and not getting the results I was looking for. To try and fix this, I had to start searching for things much more specific to help me get to what I needed to get. FOr example, I was searching for the official website for MMA, and for Taekwondo, but when I searched it, I was shown Wikipedia. That problem made me figure out that I had to get more specific with what I wrote. I had to type things like tech, and official, and sometimes even things like websites to find what I needed.

##### Patience
In my experience over writing this blog, I have learned that the internet doesn't like to work, especially late at night. Anytime I would be able to do work, which was usually at around 9 to 12, I would turn on my computer and it would never connect to the internet immediately. The first time this happened I was very impatient and decided not to do any work that day, but that backfired on me since I ended up with late work that day, and I had to try and rush through it during lunch. The next time I tried, it still didn't connect immediately, but I instead waited for it and it eventually turned on, and I was able to finish all the rest of the work I needed to do.

##### Respect
One of the many things I learned about throughout my research was just how many injuries people get in all these fights. I knew that fights were dangerous, but I never knew just how life threatening fights could actually be. I remember I'd seen something while I was watching fights where a guy got punched in the back of the neck, and he was hit so perfectly in the neck that he was basically paralyzed and could never fight again. He could barely move after it, and I found out that he only just recently began speaking and walking again. It's heartbreaking to see something like that, but it gives me a lot of respect for people who put their bodies on the line like that.
