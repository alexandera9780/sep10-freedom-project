## Context 

In my previous blog, I wrote about why I chose my topic, Martial Arts
Over the last month or so, I researched about the softwares and hardwares of martial arts. In the software side of Martial Arts, I found a few apps, and I considered what they were good for and what they were bad for. One app I found was called "Muay Thai Fitness and Workout" and while it looked good on paper, its one major flaw was that it didn't exactly show you how you needed to do certain things. I also found things like [this website](https://www.onefc.com/), which showed me three things that are technological advancements in martial arts, which included grappling dummies, and heart rate monitors. In terms of hardware, I learned that there are quite a few things that can be used for martial arts, as well as other sports. Some of those things I learned include external tracking devices, like fitbits and stuff like that, and Cryotherapy, which is basically a technologically advanced ice bath. I learned all this from [this website](https://evolve-mma.com/blog/building-the-perfect-fighter-the-role-of-technology-in-modern-mma/)
