# Entry 5
##### 04/21/25

Since the last blog entry back in March, we have begun the final parts of our freedom project. Now, we have begun learning and testing out our tools that we decided to use. I have been trying to learn and perfect jQuery for the last few weeks, and so far I've made lots of development since the last entry. One thing that mainly stands out to me is that many of the jQuery functions that you'd normally see tend to behave and write almost like Javascript. To learn as much of jQuery as I could, I used [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0eyrZgxdwhy7byLHsVkuhtRV_IpoJU7n) to help. I used that 12 video series to learn all about jQuery, and how to animate, how to use alerts, and how to use and type different functions. For example, I learned that if you want to slow down or speed up the animations that you use, you just have to type a plus or minus, and to trigger the animation, you have to target what you want to animate, and then write the animation as if it was CSS. Some other important things that should be pointed out when using jQuery is that if you want to specify a certain amount of seconds, you have to know that 1 second is equal to 1000. For example, if you wanted to use the fadeIn function and you wanted it to be in the time frame of 5 seconds, you'd put 5000.

### Skills

#### Organization
An example of organization that I have shown since the last blog entry has been using my SEP10 Notes to keep certain things much more organized for my freedom project, as well as using a learning log to keep track of my work on my IDE everytime I would learn a new piece of information. This became critical these past few weeks because without the organization that the learning log and my notes brought, I would have forgotten every detail that I learned in each video, and then I would've had to go back to a video to find what I was looking for. However now, instead of just going back to a video to find key parts, I can just refer back to my learning log and I'll find notes on everything I saw from each video, marked day by day when I watched the video.

#### Perseverance
One way I've shown perseverence in the last few weeks, especially since the last blog entry is not changing which tool I was going to use. After a couple of weeks of using jQuery, I realized that another tool I could've used was Aframe, because I could've built a 3D design of my idea for the future. However, instead of changing to Aframe at the last minute, I took a moment and instead thought up and found ways to incorperate jQuery into my freedom project where it would be useful and where it could be seen.
