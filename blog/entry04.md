Since the last Blog, we have moved on from the second part of our Freedom Project, which means we have moved on to the next part of our project. The next part of our Freedom Project is determining what tool we will be using as part of out website. The three choices I began with was [React](https://react.dev/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and [Aframe](https://aframe.io/). I began tinkering with React, and I tried to copy some codes from React into my HTML file to try them out. They never ended up working out, so I moved to my second tool, which was jQuery. At first I was going to move on to my third option because I couldn't figure out how to use jQuery either. Then I used YouTube to find a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwUOsRlDTLQ&list=PL0eyrZgxdwhy7byLHsVkuhtRV_IpoJU7n&index=2) that helped me solve my problem, which was that I'd forgotten to link my file to jQuery, since my file was originally linked to Bootstrap. Once I had figured that out, I went to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_events.asp) to find some functions since I needed to find out a few JavaScript codes to use jQuery. I never ended up testing out Aframe since I never thought I would need 3D shapes.

### Skills

#### Problem Solving
An example of problem solving that I have shown in the last few weeks has been trying to solve the problem of adding jQuery to my file. My first attempt at trying to solve this problem was when I went to the jQuery website to try and find any directions or indicators of anything I should do. When that didn't work, I decided to search it up on w3schools. When I searched through w3schools I couldn't find the exact answer I was looking for, so I went to Youtube. I watched a few videos from several different people, but eventually I settled on a 12 part tutorial on how to do jQuery, which included and helped me figure out my problem, which was that I hadn't linked my file to jQuery.

#### Creativity
An example of creativity I showed was when I had finally began to tinker with jQuery. After watching three of the videos in the twelve part series, I decided to write down some of the things that I understood, and tried them out. Instead of making a whole new webpage to test it out, I instead tested it out on some of my old [pickcode](https://app.pickcode.io/home/sandbox) webpages that I'd used before but never looked back at again. I specifically used my html-make-something to test out some of the new jQuery that I had learned, and used some of the new things I had just learned too, like ```.click``` and ```.dblclick```. I also tried to use different actions like ```alert```.
